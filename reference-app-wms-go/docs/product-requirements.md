# Workflow Management System (Go) - Product Requirements

## Vision
A Workflow Management System (WMS) is a mission-critical system for managing 
worker routines, task assignments, and time tracking in specialty contractor 
businesses.

Reliability is essential, as the system tracks worker time, manages task 
assignments, and ensures proper break management - all of which directly 
impact worker productivity, compliance, and satisfaction. The WMS must be 
resilient to failures, maintaining accurate state even during system 
interruptions. It must also provide clear visibility into worker status, 
task progress, and daily operations.
